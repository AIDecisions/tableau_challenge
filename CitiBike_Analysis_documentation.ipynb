This notebook provides deep insights into the Citi Bike data from 2023. We'll explore various aspects of the data, including usage patterns, station popularity, and the impact of different bike types.

## 1. Usage Patterns by Membership Type

### Trip Duration by Membership Type

We observe that members tend to have shorter trips compared to casual users. The majority of member trips are under 20 minutes, while casual users have a wider distribution of trip durations.

### Ride Start Time by Membership Type

There is a clear difference in ride start times between members and casual users. Members are more likely to start rides during traditional commuting hours (8 AM and 5-6 PM), while casual users have a more even distribution throughout the day.

## 2. Peak Usage Times

### Hourly and Daily Trends

Rides are most frequent during the morning and evening rush hours, particularly on weekdays. The number of rides dips significantly late at night and early in the morning.

## 3. Station Popularity

### Top 10 Start and End Stations

Certain stations, like 'W 21 St & 6 Ave' and 'Broadway & W 58 St,' are particularly popular for starting and ending rides. This information can be used to optimize bike distribution across the network.

## 4. Trip Distance vs. Duration

### Correlation Between Trip Distance and Duration

There is a positive correlation between trip distance and duration. Electric bikes tend to cover longer distances in shorter times compared to classic bikes.

## 5. Spatial Distribution of Trips

### Geographic Distribution of Rides

The geographic distribution shows that most rides are concentrated in central Manhattan, with significant activity in areas like Midtown and the Financial District.

## Conclusion

These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of Citi Bike usage patterns in 2023, highlighting key trends and areas for potential optimization.
